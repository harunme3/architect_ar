## 0.2.1

- **Fix(iOS)**: Handle swipe-to-dismiss on RoomPlan UI via `UIAdaptivePresentationControllerDelegate` — the Dart `Future` from `startScanning()` now always completes instead of hanging forever.
- **Fix(iOS)**: Replace deprecated `UIApplication.shared.windows` with `UIWindowScene.windows` via `connectedScenes` for root view controller access.
- **Fix(Dart)**: Add missing `ObjectCategory` values (`television`, `fireplace`, `stairs`, `bathtub`, `dishwasher`) to match the Swift-side enum — previously these objects would return `unknown`.
- **Fix(Dart)**: Replace 3 duplicate `_listEquals` implementations with `listEquals` from `package:flutter/foundation.dart`.
- **Docs(Dart)**: Document `ScanConfiguration` limitations — only `quality` is effective on iOS 16; other fields are reserved for iOS 17+.
- **Refactor(Dart)**: Remove unused `lib/src/models/` dead code (5 files, ~250 lines) with legacy Portuguese strings.
- **Chore(iOS)**: Bump podspec version to 0.2.1 and replace deprecated `s.swift_version` with `s.swift_versions`.

## 0.2.0
